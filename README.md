# UserName_by_Tag
Input a hash tag, and run.  The output is a list of Instagram users who recently posted with this tag. 


In order to run this, you need all Anaconda libraries installed for Python3, and Chrome Webdriver installed in your Python Library folder. 

You will be asked to input the Tag without the # symbol, and the number of users you'd like to get.
